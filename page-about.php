          <h4 data-number="1."><a href="#">Creative Services</a><br><br></h4>
          <p>The mission at Crucible Productions is to connect with audiences through creative storytelling. That mission starts in our creative services department. Crucible writers, directors, designers, and creative directors are each master storytellers with diverse narrative experiences in film, television, advertising. They’re the reason the work we produce is so engaging, entertaining, and satisfying. Regardless of the format or genre, our creative services team approaches every project the same way: tell the most compelling story possible. As a full-service video production studio, Indigo develops, creates, and executes projects from beginning to end. This gives us the unique ability to maintain the highest caliber of creative integrity through all aspects of pre-production, production, and post-production.</p>

          <p>Crucible Productions is a full-service video production company based in Bangalore, India. We manage every aspect of a project’s physical production from development, physical production, and post production through to final delivery and all nine million aspects in between.

          <p>At Crucible Productions, we believe every project is greater than the sum of its produced parts.</p>
          <p> When all those parts are combined together and juxtaposed in just the right way, they take on a life of their own as a unified creative vision with greater meaning, stronger emotion, and deeper subtext than anyone could have anticipated or planned for in advance.</p>
          <p>Some people call this part of the process “the magic.” We just call it post-production:</p>
